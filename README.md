This version of the FIDICbot was originally based on the SarahSays Microsoft Bot Framework "Hello World" and was deployed to Heroku with Node, as described <a href="https://github.com/boswellp/BotFramework">here</a>.
The bot was then deployed to Azure and is currently available on Skype <img alt="Add Bot to Skype" height="30" width="130" src="https://secure.skypeassets.com/content/dam/scom/images/add-bot-button/add-to-skype-buttons02-28px.png" />

The main FIDICbot is deployed to Heroku with multichannel integration by Smooch for Messenger, Telegram, LINE, Wechat, Viber  and SMS (via Twilio). The web version is at <a href="http://fidic.pw">fidic.pw</a> with support provided as part of the <a href="//fidic.tips/">FIDIC.tips</a> service.

There is also a Twitter Direct Messages version of FIDICbot based on the <a href="https://github.com/twitterdev/twitter-webhook-boilerplate-node">Twitter Webhook Boilerplate Node</a>, a node.js framework. It is deployed to Heroku but does not use Smooch for integration. The Github source will be made available publically.
