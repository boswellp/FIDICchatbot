<h3>FIDICbot - MBF version for Skype</h3>

This version of the FIDICbot chatbot to access FIDIC works contracts and services agreements was originally based on the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/sarahsays/2016/">SarahSays</a> Microsoft Bot Framework "Hello World" and was deployed to Heroku with Node, as described <a href="https://github.com/boswellp/BotFramework">here</a>.

The bot was then deployed to Azure and is currently available as a web app on <a href="http://fidicbot.azurewebsites.net/">Azure</a> on and <a href="http://www.fidic.tips/fidicbot/mbf/">FIDIC.tips</a> and on Skype <a href="https://join.skype.com/bot/c6076e92-cae8-4b0b-83da-565b83d5c8c6"><img alt="Add Bot to Skype" height="30" width="130" src="https://secure.skypeassets.com/content/dam/scom/images/add-bot-button/add-to-skype-buttons02-28px.png" /></a>

The main FIDICbot is deployed to Heroku with multichannel integration by Smooch for Messenger, Telegram, LINE, Wechat, Viber  and SMS (via Twilio). The web version of the main FIDICbot is at <a href="http://fidic.pw">fidic.pw</a> with support provided as part of the <a href="http://fidic.tips/">FIDIC.tips</a> service.

There was also a Twitter Direct Messages version of FIDICbot based on the <a href="https://github.com/twitterdev/twitter-webhook-boilerplate-node">Twitter Webhook Boilerplate Node</a>, a node.js framework. It is deployed to Heroku but does not use Smooch for integration. The Github source will be made available publically. It was @FIDICbot at <a href="https://twitter.com/fidicbot/">twitter.com/fidicbot</a>, with a logon necessary to access.
